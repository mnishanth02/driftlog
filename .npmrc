# Note: `expo-doctor`/`expo install --check` invoke npm for dependency validation.
# `node-linker` is a pnpm-specific setting and causes npm to warn, which then fails the check.
# If you truly need hoisted node_modules for pnpm, prefer setting it in your *user* pnpm config
# instead of committing it at the project level.
